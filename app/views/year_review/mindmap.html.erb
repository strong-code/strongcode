# Valus & Purpose


# Location & Tangibles


# Money, Finances & Business
FBA
- goal is $3k recurring by EOY, >2 products
- mutliple false starts in 2016
- too focused on finding "perfect product"
- Should not be worried by logistics, sea freight, ungating, etc
Savings
- Did a great job of paying off A/a
- Did a good (but not great) job of replenishing emergency fund. Dipped in 1-2 times when overbudget though
- Budgets are a dynamic thing and need to be reworked every few months
- Should savings scale as income increases?
Cashflow
- Important to move serious projects into their own bank accounts. Once they show potential to take off, separate the financials
- Buying MacInfo was good, but need to start moving the needle on traffic and continue increased earnings (focus on content AND advertising)
- Get >700 credit score (627 -> 694 in 2016)
- Get emergency fund >$12k
- Budgets, spending, on being thrifty
- Less ubers, restrict budget to $80/mo
- Should really try fixing things and doing them myself instead of paying someone or buying new things (e.g. broken vacuum)


# Fitness & Physical Health
- Injuries
  - Surgery in Jan
  - Back and knee issues
  - General flexibility and mobility, muscle health, overall health, lingering issues
- Diabetes
  - Importance of checking blood sugar. This sets you up for success and ignoring it has cascading downstream effects
  - Diet and its effects
- Strength
  - Definitely went off track this year - why?
  - Need to create a program that addresses strength and aesthetics, but mainly increasing compounds in winter and accessory work in summer
  - What are my goals for 2017? 4 plate DL, 315x5 squat, 250x5 bench
  - Would like to come in at >= 168 pounds for summer
- Aesthetics
  - Summer cut actually went well
  - Start earlier in 2017, dedicate to 10 (?) weeks, aiming to COMPLETE by June
- Sleep
  - New mattress is needed
  - Need to focus on 8 hours of SLEEP per night. This means allows ~20 min buffer after getting in to bed to fall asleep
  - Get sleep study performed to evaluate sleep quality

# Education & Cognitive Skills
- Focus
  - deliberate focus
  - extended periods
  - can be distracted and pulled off track by texts, doing psuedo-busy tasks like checking revenue or traffic numbers - limit this?
- Reading
  - I can get off track when a book disinterests me. Feel free to PUT IT DOWN. There is always the option to revisit
  - Should finish year at 16 books. 52/year is unreasonable and encourages rushing through books. Next year should be 32?
  - What areas of literature do I want to focus on? Have I ignored some genres?
  - Am I absorbing the information I read? Am I able to take away something from the book of value, whether information or reading/writing skills? Applied reading
- Skills
  - Learned Javascript/ES6/Node
  - False start on guitar. Why did I stop playing? Why am I not playing now?
  - Wanted to start on electronics and physical engineering but did not. How can I begin and stick with this in 2017? Projects that have meaning and purpose and defined end goals
  - False start on duolingo spanish. Do I care enough to learn another language? Do I honestly have time and the will to? Probably not right now. ROI seems low currently
  - Learning ML/Deep Learning/Data Science in 2017. Again, how can I set myself up to learn and stick with it? Have defined goals and projects/milestones I want to achieve. Make them REALISTIC and ACHIEVEABLE
- Mental Models
  - Biases i've learned about and worked on avoided. Those that I still fall victim to
- Side projects/Programming
  - Github commits overall are up a lot
  - False starts on Postify & FirstOffer. Front end dev really puts me off from continuing. Is it because I dont know how to move fast with it and get frustrated?
  - Strongco.de, Dotfiles and Botto had a lot of good work done on them.
  - Lots of small projects that were utilities. Waste of time or do they have merit? What did I learn from them?
  - Avoid rushed money-grab projects like vote4vote and pokescanner. Although first mover is not to be underestimated.
